  # Target Dataset Analysis – Data Analyst Portfolio Project

This project is a detailed analysis of the Target Dataset from Kaggle, aimed at demonstrating my data analysis skills through a simulated retail business case. It covers data cleaning, exploration, SQL querying, and business insight generation—similar to what a data analyst might do in a real-world setting.

## Project Description

The dataset simulates a retail environment and includes information on customers, orders, products, and sellers. Using this data, I explored various business questions to understand purchasing behavior, product performance, and customer retention trends.

The project includes:

- Structured SQL queries for insights
- Visualizations for better understanding of trends
- Analytical summaries across different complexity levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced

## Files in This Project

- `data_exploration.ipynb` – Initial inspection and cleaning of the dataset.
- `sql_queries_and_analysis.ipynb` – SQL queries executed using SQLite or PandasQL to answer key business questions.
- `queries_reference.txt` – A categorized collection of queries (basic to advanced) used during analysis.
- `visualizations.ipynb` – Graphs and plots that help visualize trends and support insights.

## Dataset Details

This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and includes four main CSV files:

- **customers.csv** – Customer location data
- **orders.csv** – Order transactions with timestamps and related IDs
- **products.csv** – Product details like name, price, and category
- **sellers.csv** – Seller information

## Key Questions and Analysis Areas

### Basic

- What are the unique cities customers are from?
- How many orders were placed in 2017?
- What is the total sales value per product category?
- How many orders were paid in installments?
- How many customers are from each state?

### Intermediate

- Number of orders per month in 2018
- Average number of products per order, by city
- Revenue share by category
- Correlation between product price and purchase count
- Total revenue by seller, ranked

### Advanced

- Moving average of order values per customer
- Cumulative sales by month for each year
- Year-over-year growth in total sales
- Customer retention (repeat purchase within 6 months)
- Top 3 highest-spending customers by year

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (via SQLite / PandasQL)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Git and GitHub

## What This Project Shows

Through this project, I’ve demonstrated the ability to:
- Handle structured, relational datasets
- Write clear and efficient SQL queries
- Use Python for deeper analysis and visualization
- Generate actionable business insights
- Communicate findings in a clean and understandable format
